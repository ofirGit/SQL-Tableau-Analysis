**Project**

 I used with SQL +Tableau integration to create a Dashboard for Classicmodels with the help of queries and visualizing in Tabluea
 for answering the following questions:

- how many customers are in each office?
- What is the average of  sales from different countries for each year, starting from 2003?
- who's the top sale representative for 2005? 
- What is the average payment per customer within a certain credit limit range (for example: platinum = credit limit>100000)?
