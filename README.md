**Project**

 I used with SQL +Tableau integration to create a Dashboard for Classicmodels with the help of queries and visualizing in Tabluea
 for answering the following questions:

- how many customers are in each office?
- What is the average of  sales from different countries for each year, starting from 2003?
- who's the top sale representative for 2005? 
- What is the average payment per customer within a certain credit limit range (for example: platinum = credit limit>100000)?

**Conclusion**

- In all of the offices There was a major decrease in the sales volume.
- Despite of the highest amount of customers in USA, there was a major decrease in sales - USA sales volume has fallen sharply.
- Japan office's sales has been in decrease since 2003. the number of customers is the lowest and so is the sales volume of the agent in the last year (2005). 
- Due the results of the analysis above, I strongly recommend to merge offices and reduce the number of sales agents.
